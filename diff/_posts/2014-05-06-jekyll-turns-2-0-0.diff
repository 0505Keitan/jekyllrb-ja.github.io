 1. [Collections](/docs/collections/) - Collections allow you to define an unlimited number of custom document types (beyond just posts and pages) for different types of content you may want to author in Jekyll such as API documentation or a cookbook!
 2. [Brand new site template](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/pull/2050#issuecomment-35938016) (thanks [@jglovier][]!) - Getting started with Jekyll just got a lot easier and a lot more beautiful. Just run `jekyll new <path>` and you're good to go.
 3. [Native Sass & CoffeeScript support](/docs/assets/) - We love CSS and JavaScript as much as the next guy, but there will always be a special place in our hearts for Sass and CoffeeScript. We now offer native support for these file types &mdash; no more messing around with Rake or Grunt!
-4. [YAML Front-Matter defaults](/docs/configuration/#frontmatter-defaults) - If you've set `layout: post` more than once in your life, you'll love this new feature: set front-matter defaults for a given directory or type.
+4. [YAML Front Matter defaults](/docs/configuration/#front-matter-defaults) - If you've set `layout: post` more than once in your life, you'll love this new feature: set front matter defaults for a given directory or type.
 5. [Custom markdown processors](/docs/configuration/#custom-markdown-processors) - Always wanted to use your favourite home-grown Markdown converter, but couldn't with Jekyll? Now you can. Simply specify `markdown: MyConverterClass` and you're on your way.
 6. [Addition of `where` and `group_by` Liquid filters](/docs/templates/#filters) - Simplifying your Liquid templates one filter at a time. The `where` filter selects from an array all items within which have a given value for a property. The `group_by` filter groups all items in an array which have the same value for a given property.
 7. [Switch from Maruku to Kramdown as default markdown converter](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/pull/1988) - Maruku is dead. We've replaced it with the converter which has the closest feature parity: Kramdown!

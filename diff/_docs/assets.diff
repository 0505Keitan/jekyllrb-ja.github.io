 Jekyll treats these files the same as a regular page, in that the output file
 will be placed in the same directory that it came from. For instance, if you
-have a file named `/css/styles.scss` in your site's source folder, Jekyll
+have a file named `css/styles.scss` in your site's source folder, Jekyll
 will process it and put it in your site's destination folder under
-`/css/styles.css`.
+`css/styles.css`.

+  <h5>Jekyll processes all Liquid filters and tags in asset files</h5>
+  <p>If you are using <a href="http://mustache.github.io">Mustache</a>
+     or another JavaScript templating language that conflicts with
+     the <a href="/docs/templates/">Liquid template syntax</a>, you
+     will need to place <code>{&#37; raw &#37;}</code> and
+     <code>{&#37; endraw &#37;}</code> tags around your code.</p>

 ## Sass/SCSS
 
 Jekyll allows you to customize your Sass conversion in certain ways.
 
+Place all your partials in your `sass_dir`, which defaults to
+`<source>/_sass`. Place your main SCSS or Sass files in the place you want
+them to be in the output file, such as `<source>/css`. For an example, take
+a look at [this example site using Sass support in Jekyll][example-sass].
+
 If you are using Sass `@import` statements, you'll need to ensure that your
 `sass_dir` is set to the base directory that contains your Sass files. You
 can do that thusly:
     sass_dir: _sass
 {% endhighlight %}
 
-The Sass converter will default to `_sass`.
+The Sass converter will default the `sass_dir` configuration option to
+`_sass`.

+
+<div class="note info">
+  <h5>The <code>sass_dir</code> is only used by Sass</h5>
+  <p>
+
+    Note that the <code>sass_dir</code> becomes the load path for Sass imports,
+    nothing more. This means that Jekyll does not know about these files
+    directly, so any files here should not contain the YAML Front Matter as
+    described above nor will they be transformed as described above. This
+    folder should only contain imports.
+
+  </p>
+</div>
 
 You may also specify the output style with the `style` option in your
 `_config.yml` file:
